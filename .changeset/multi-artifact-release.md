"2048": patch
---

GitHub Releases now tag automatically once the bot-maintained "Version Packages" PR merges, and attach two PET `.prg` builds — a stock 4K 2001 and the existing 32K 4032 — alongside the web `.wasm`, built from a matrix declared in `8bitscript.config.ts` (`targets.pet.release`) instead of duplicated into CI.

Requires 8BitScript/8bitscript v0.4.0 (`@8bitscript/cli` and friends bumped accordingly) for `8bs build --release` and the renamed `8bitscript.config.ts`.
